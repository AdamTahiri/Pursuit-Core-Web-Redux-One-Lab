## Assignment

For this lab, implement the Redux code necessary to make this app work:

- The `+` button should use the provided `INCREMENT` action to increase the state by 1
- The `-` button should use the provided `DECREMENT` action to decrease the state by 1
- Add a `reset` button that resets count to 0 with a new `RESET` action

You will need to set up `Counter` with the necessary selectors and dispatchers.

## Bonus

- Add a `+ if even` button that only increments if the value is even with a new `INCREMENT_IF_EVEN` action
- Add an input field that lets you set the count to whatever number you type in with a new `INCREMENT_BY` action
